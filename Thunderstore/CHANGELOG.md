| 1.1.3     | - Golden told me to. I swear. I promise. Golden is happy person now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 1.1.2     | - It has been requested that the Power Amount variable accept float values (to support things like 0.5). This is now possible                                                                                                                                                             |
| 1.1.1     | - Fix an issue that could cause your Eitr to be halved if your Blood Magic was above Elemental Magic. Blood magic was performing the calculation correctly and it only seemed like it was being halved.                                                                                   |
| 1.1.0     | - Add ServerSync due to it now being configurable<br/>- Allow all math variables besides the level to be configurable<br/>- Add in a version check for when it's installed on the server<br/>- The math changes basically result in additional eitr of about half of the original version |
| 1.0.0     | Initial Release                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
